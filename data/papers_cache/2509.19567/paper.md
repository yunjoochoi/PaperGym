## Abstract

This work investigates retrieval augmented generation as an efficient strategy for automatic context discovery in context-aware Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system, in order to improve transcription accuracy in the presence of rare or out-of-vocabulary terms. However, identifying the right context automatically remains an open challenge. This work proposes an efficient embedding-based retrieval approach for automatic context discovery in ASR. To contextualize its effectiveness, two alternatives based on large language models (LLMs) are also evaluated: (1) large language model (LLM)-based context generation via prompting, and (2) post-recognition transcript correction using LLMs. Experiments on the TEDLIUMv3, Earnings21 and SPGISpeech demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces WER by up to 17% (percentage difference) relative to using no-context, while the oracle context results in a reduction of up to 24.1%.

## 1 Introduction

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have gained considerable development over the last few years and provide high transcription accuracy over an extensive spectrum of tasks and benchmarks (Park et al., 2019; Gulati et al., 2020; Baevski et al., 2020). Even though ASR systems have grown tremendously, ASR systems' performance continues to degrade under conditions of low-occurrence or out-of-vocabulary words like names, specialized domain names, and userpersonal references (Jain et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2023). To address this, several strategies have emerged, including ASR personalization (Gourav et al., 2021; Sathyendra et al., 2022), text injection (Sainath et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2024), and contextual biasing (CB) (Huang et al., 2024; Meng et al., 2024). Among these, CB has received significant attention due to its effectiveness in improving recognition of rare and user-specific terms.

One of the core challenges of contextual ASR is the definition and extraction of context. The success of biasing depends not only on model architecture but also on how well contextual material aligns to audio semantics (Han et al., 2022).

Several works have explored CB by tightly integrating with the ASR model through adapters or attention mechanisms over entity catalogs. Muralidhar et al. (Muralidhar Jayanthi et al., 2023) propose a retrieval-based personalization method, where ASR encoder representations query an infrequent entity catalog to retrieve phonetically similar candidates via a contextual adapter. Tong et al. (Tong et al., 2023b) extend this by using slot-specific catalogs and combining entity embeddings with ASR outputs through a cross-attention mechanism. These methods generally rely on fine-tuning the ASR backbone and assume access to structured entity catalogs, often annotated by domain/slot type.

Recent research has explored large language models (LLMs) for contextual ASR tasks. Xiao et al. (Xiao et al., 2025) build a contextual knowledge base from custom vocabularies and documents, using a first-pass ASR output to prompt an LLM for error correction. Sun et al. (Sun et al., 2024) fine-tune an LLM for token prediction and entity classification, applying it to second-pass hypothesis rescoring. These approaches, while effective, typically involve fine-tuning and curated entity prompts, which can limit adaptability across domains or resource-constrained settings.

Finally, Mathur et al. (Mathur et al., 2024) propose DOC-RAG, a domain-sensitive framework that builds domain-specific corpora and uses cooccurrence matrices to estimate next-word probabilities for ASR rescoring. Retrieval-based approaches such as those in (Muralidhar Jayanthi et al., 2023; Tong et al., 2023b) also leverage similarity search mechanisms, but their retrieval is conditioned on either learned audio embeddings or manually annotated slot labels, making them dependent on supervised signals and ASR model internals.

Figure 1: Overview of the proposed context-aware ASR pipeline. Context for each segment is extracted using either an embedding-based retrieval method or LLM-based prompt generation, both conditioned on the preceding k segment captions. Audio is segmented via Voice Activity Detection (VAD). The selected context is provided to a contextual ASR system. Optionally, a post-ASR LLM correction module refines the transcript. The final output is the concatenation of all the individual segment transcripts.

The majority of existing methods assume structured catalogs (Muralidhar Jayanthi et al., 2023; Tong et al., 2023b), require architectural modifications to ASR models (Tong et al., 2023b,a), or depend on domain-specific supervision (Sun et al., 2024; Mathur et al., 2024), limiting their flexibility in general or black-box settings. Inspired by prior work, this study proposes a lightweight, modular approach that avoids such constraints. Specifically, it proposes an embedding-based retrieval strategy using pre-trained MiniLM embeddings over a large vocabulary, entirely decoupled from the ASR model architecture. This method is evaluated alongside two LLM-based alternatives: a prompt-based context generator and a post-ASR transcript corrector.

Earlier context-biasing techniques are deeply integrated into the ASR model itself - requiring custom layers, retraining, or access to model internals - so can't be run on the black-box recognizer used in this work. Consequently, we benchmark only 'plug-and-play' methods in a common pipeline that mirrors real-world deployment scenarios (identical audio inputs, metrics, and latency limits).

This paper has three main contributions:

- First, it introduces a novel, model-agnostic, retrieval-based context construction technique using MiniLM embeddings on top of a frozen vocabulary to enable efficient context generation.
- Second, it offers an experimental comparison of plug-and-play solutions to automatic context combination in ASR, including LLMbased context generation and post-hoc transcript fine-tuning.
- Third, it provides an end-to-end evaluation of all methods in a shared pipeline that works without fine-tuning the ASR model, using black-box models and real-world long-form audio corpora.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the proposed methodology, Sections 3 and 4 the experimental setup and results, and finally the paper concludes in Section 5.

## 2 Methods

An overview of the proposed approach is presented in Figure 1, and explained in the next subsections.

## 2.1 Contextual ASR

The ASR model is defined as a conditional decoder: ˆ y t = A ( s t | C t ) where ˆ y t is the predicted transcript of segment s t , conditioned on the context list C t .

As a further use of LLMs, their use for post-ASR corrections has been investigated. The correction model Mfi x produces a revised transcript, which is the original sentence with corrected typos and misspellings: ˆ y corr t = Mfi x (ˆ y t , C t , H t -1 , P fix ) where H t -1 denotes the corrected transcript history up to segment y t -1 and P fix the prompt used to instruct the LLM to fix the transcript. The use of ˆ y corr t for context is hereby denoted as LLM-fix . Llama3.2 (3B) is utilized for all experiments requiring an LLM without loss of generality.

## 2.2 Context Construction

Let ˆ y t be the transcript generated by ASR for segment s t (identified by a Voice Activity Detection (VAD) module) and let the transcript of the previous k segments be ˆ Y t -1 = concat ( ˆ y t -1 , ..., ˆ y t -k ) . ˆ Y t -1 is utilized to retrieve words contextually rele- vant to s t which are merged into a context list that's passed to the ASR system for processing.

Each word w i in the vocabulary V = { w 1 , . . . , w |V| } is embedded using a function f : V → R d , such that f ( w i ) = v i ∈ R d . The MiniLM (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) is utilized, similarly to BertTopic 1 , where it is employed to encode textual segments and identify semantically related terms within a topic. The query vector q t ∈ R d for segment s t is computed as: q t = f ( ˆ Y t -1 ) , effectively retrieving terms that align with the latent "spoken topic" of the segment, even when they are not explicitly mentioned.

TopN context words are selected by maximizing cosine similarity:

Efficient nearest-neighbor search is performed via FAISS(Douze et al., 2024) indexing. The use of C rag t for context is hereby denoted as CB-RAG .

Alternatively, an LLM-based approach for context construction is examined. Given the same prior window ˆ Y t -1 and a prompt P gen are passed to an LLM M gen, returning:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The output context is post-processed to remove duplicates and stopwords. The use of C llm t for context is hereby denoted as CB-LLM .

## 2.3 Baselines

In order to measure the impact of context information quantitatively, two baseline reference strategies are utilized: the lower and upper bound of performance. Let the ground-truth transcript for segment s t be denoted as y t . The Oracle context (lower bound on WER) is constructed as: C oracle t = { w ∈ y t | w / ∈ S} where S denotes a predefined stopword list 2 . This assumes perfect knowledge of all the context terms and corresponds to the lower bound.

The no-context baseline (upper bound on WER) corresponds to C none t = ∅ meaning no contextual information is provided to the ASR system and corresponds to the upper bound.

## 3 Experimental Setup

## 3.1 Dataset

The experiments are conducted on three datasets: TED-LIUMv3 (Hernandez et al., 2018) (~1.5 hours of audio), Earnings21 (Del Rio et al., 2021) (~5 hours of audio) and SPGISpeech ( ? ) (~5 hours of audio). SPGISpeech consist of 5-15 seconds utterances grouped by sessions. Since context extraction methods require longer audio to capture contextual information, sessions were concatenated, and only segments longer than 6 minutes were retained, perseving topic consistency.

To ensure consistency, transcripts are preprocessed before evaluation. Non-verbal content and non-English segments are removed. Text is normalized through lowercasing, punctuation stripping, hyphen removal, and conversion of numerical expressions to word format.

For the vocabulary V , a set of 466,358 unique, non-stop words 3 is utilized for context generation using RAG. These words are combined together with their definitions (if available).

Let T denote the set of entity types that are considered rare 4 and let E T be the set of named entities of types in T , extracted from the reference transcripts. We define the set of rare entities as E rare = { e ∈ E T | type ( e ) ∈ T ∧ e / ∈ S} and the set of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) entities as E oov = { e ∈ E rare | e / ∈ V} . To assess the lexical coverage and contextual demands of each dataset, we perform a rare entity analysis. Table 1 reports the percentage of unique words not present in the static vocabulary ( V ) and the proportion of rare entities.

Table 1: Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) and the percentage of rare words appearing across the speech datasets.

| Metrics   | TEDLIUMv3   | Earnings21   | SPGISpeech   |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| OOV       | 6.31%       | 13.49%       | 15.77%       |
| Rare rate | 28%         | 38%          | 6.16%        |

## 3.2 ASR Model

The context module of the ASR system implemented is based on the approach proposed by (Jalal et al., 2023), which introduces a CB mechanism that integrates contextually relevant external information during inference. Following Figure 1 we perform contextual biasing ASR per audio segment. For VAD, the SpeechBrain (Ravanelli et al., 2024) library is utilized. After all segments are processed, their outputs are concatenated to reconstruct the full transcript.

## 3.3 Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the proposed contextual ASR system is evaluated using word error rate (WER), the standard metric for transcription accuracy. A contextual overlap score is calculated to assess how much of the ground-truth context is correctly recovered by each method, serving as a proxy for semantic recall. The size of the extracted context list per segment is also reported, indicating the expressive capacity of each method.

## 4 Results

Table 2 presents the result of the proposed method and alternatives on TED-LIUMv3, Earnings21 and SPGISpeech. Regarding CB-RAG , multiple configurations were investigated regarding the number of context words to retrieve with each query ( c ) and the number of segments to be used for the query construction ( k ).

As shown in Table 2, the CB-RAG method on TED-LIUMv3 exhibits a consistent reduction in WER as the number of retrieved contexts c increases, from 17.6% at c =100 to 16.4% at c =250. Reducing the number of segments k also results in improved performance: the [250,10] configuration yields a WER of 16.4%, compared to 17.1% for [250,100]. Although LLM-based methods achieve higher context overlap (45.3-48.7%), CB-RAG compensates through significantly higher context counts (up to 12%), suggesting it access more diverse and redundant set of candidate segments. Regarding computational efficiency, CB-RAG demonstrates substantially lower latency, 1.02-1.36 times slower than no-context baseline, relative to LLM-based approaches, which are 4.66-6.16 times. Among CB-LLM variants, precorrecting the ASR's transcript slightly improves WER(from 16.9% to 16.8%). Overall, the [250,10] CB-RAG configuration provides the most balanced trade-off across accuracy, overlap, and latency, indicating strong suitability for real-time deployment.

Similar trends are observed in the Earnings21 dataset. Increasing c improves WER from 32.5% at [100,10] to 31.1% at [250, 10], approaching the LLM-based results ( ≈ 31 . 7% ) despite lower overlap. LLM-based methods again show high overlap values, peaking at 56.1%, while CB-RAG ranges between 8.8% and 21.4%. The retrieval count for CB-RAG is also considerably higher, with [250,10] reaching 15.17 compared to 9.06 for CB-LLM . Latency for CB-RAG remains much lower, ranging from 1.14 to 1.02, compared to CB-LLM decoding times of 3.26 to 3.59. The [250,10] configuration again offers the best balance, with a WER of 31.1%, overlap of 21.4%, and a time cost of just 1.12. These results demonstrate CB-RAG 's ability to scale effectively across different domains while maintaining a strong balance between accuracy and efficiency.

Although LLM-based approaches achieve the best relative WER improvement in SPGISpeech (16.96%), CB-RAG configurations closely follow (16.52%). As shown in Table 1, the dataset features a high OOV rate and few rare entities. However, despite this lexical mismatch, CB-RAG remains equivalent to the LLM-based methods. Reducing the number of segments k from 100 to 10 again improves WER, reinforcing the value of recent focused context. As with other datasets, LLM-based methods show the highest contextual overlap (up to 43.7%), while CB-RAG achieves slightly higher context count (up to 9.4 × ) and significantly lower latency, with the [100,100] configuration running at just 1.31 × the cost of the No Context baseline. These results underscore CB-RAG 's efficiency and adaptability, even under challenging lexical conditions.

The results indicate that the proposed CB-RAG approach is a competitive and effective method for automatic context construction without the use of user-specific historical text data. It is also a better alternative compared to LLM-based context creation and transcript correction. Although CB-RAG has lower contextual overlap scores, the WER is better with significantly lower latency, depicting its utility in actual scenarios. Its flexibility in selecting word context size extraction by each query ( c ) and number of segments in the past to consider ( k ) enables flexible application across domains with varied requirements for latency and performance. These findings suggest that CB-RAG would be particularly appropriate for resource-constrained or real-time applications for which LLM-based alternatives would be computationally infeasible.

## 5 Conclusion

This paper explored different approaches to incorporating contextual information into ASR pipelines, with an emphasis on automatic context extraction. Among the approaches examined - embeddingbased retrieval, context generated by LLM, and post-ASR correction - the proposed CB-RAG framework achieved the best overall performance, yielding the lowest WER (up to a 17% relative reduction) in test sets at the lowest computational cost and latency. Despite a substantially lower context overlap, up to 47.3% absolute difference, CB-RAG retrieved significantly higher number of contextual tokens, while operating, on average 83.5%, lower latency than LLM-based alternatives. PostASRcorrection improved slightly but still remained less than that of CB-RAG . These findings highlight CB-RAG as the most scalable and adaptable solution, combining high accuracy with efficiency.

## Limitations

There are several limitations acknowledged. The CB-RAG approach is lexically sensitive and might overlook semantically similar terms. It also assumes the presence of candidate context entries, which under unconstrained environments might not always be realistic. The CB-LLM method depends on prompt quality and is prone to variability across model versions and decoding parameters. Also, the LLM-fix is a post-processing step, and its performance tends to degrade in the presence of low-resource hardware or noisy transcription.

## Impact of Model and Encoder Choice

Table 3 provides a deeper comparison of different model backbones used within the CB-LLM , CB-LLM &amp; LLM\_fix and CB-RAG frameworks across TED-LIUMv3 and Earnings21.

In TED-LIUMv3, the best WER (16.4%) is achieved by CB-RAG [250,10] using all-MiniLM-L6-v2 , representing a 13.2% relative improvement over the no-context baseline. Among LLM-based methods, smollm2:135m delivers the strongest performance with a WER of 16.6%, followed closely by smollm2:365m , which is the faster among LLM variants. The highest contextual overlap (81.8%) and context tokens

(19.73 × ) are achieved by the tinyllama:1.1b , while gemma2:4b is significantly the slowest. The LLM\_fix mechanism introduces a mean latency increase of approximately 2.3 times, affecting larger models like olmo2:7b the most, while impacting smaller ones like tinyllama much less.

Similar trends are observed in Earnings21, where the best WER (31.1%) is again obtained by CB-RAG [250,10] with all-MiniLM-L6-v2 -corresponding to a 13.4% relative improvement. This configuration also yields the highest retrieval count (15.17 times than Oracle ), while smollm2:135m achieves the highest contextual overlap (79.1%) among LLM-based approaches. As with TED-LIUMv3, LLM-based correction is slowing down transcription by approximately 2.3 times, with olmo2:7b experiencing the steepest latency increase (around 7 times). Interestingly, llama3.2 runs faster than both large and mini LLM models. Among LLMs, tinyllama again generates the most context tokens, while smollm2 leads in overlap. Again, CB-RAG encoders based on MiniLM demonstrate high efficiency, with the [250,100] configuration achieving both high accuracy and the fastest runtime across all models (approximately 1.02 times).

Across both datasets, CB-RAG with all-MiniLM-L6-v2 stands out as the most effective model, offering the best WERs, high retrieval counts, and low latency. The [250,10] configuration consistently perform well, balancing accuracy and speed. Among LLMs, smollm2:135m surpasses larger models such as llama3.2 in both WER and efficiency, making it a strong choice for constrained environments. Within the CB-RAG framework, MiniLM-L6-v2 also achieves the highest contextual overlap (18.1% more than the lowest-performing mpnet-base-v2 ). The fastest encoder is MiniLM-L12-v2 , outperforming the slowest models ( distilroberta and mpnet-base-v2 ) by approximately 7% in runtime. These results reinforce the importance of model selection in both LLM-based and retrieval-based pipelines and highlight that compact models, when properly configured, can rival or even outperform larger architectures.

The choice of backbone models plays a critical role in balancing quality and efficiency. Within CB-RAG , the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 encoder offered the best trade-off, consistently delivering the highest accuracy and fastest inference. For LLM- based methods, llama3.2 achieves competitive performance and speed, however, in scenarios with stricter latency constraints, smaller models like smollm2:135m are necessary to maintain responsiveness.

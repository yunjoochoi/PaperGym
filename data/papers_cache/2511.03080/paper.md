scarcity of resources, TN systems must also handle contextual ambiguities that arise within or across languages. The same surface form can be normalized differently depending on both the linguistic context and the target language, as illustrated in Figure 1 1 .

Later development lead to TN systems that are based on statistical and hybrid data-driven approaches (Grali´ nski et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2007; Sproat and Jaitly, 2016). For example, Grali´ nski et al. (2006) treated TN as a machine translation problem, mapping textual representations into their spoken equivalents, while Zhu et al. (2007) introduced a unified tagging approach using Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to simultaneously handle multiple TN subtasks, emphasizing their interdependencies. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in addressing these limitations by leveraging their broad linguistic knowledge. Zhang et al. (2024) used GPT models to perform text normalization in few-shot scenarios, incorporating self-consistency reasoning and linguistically informed prompt engineering, achieving error rates approximately 40% lower than those of production-level WFST systems.

Building on prior research that focused on English and GPT models, this work introduces PolyNorm, an LLM-assisted TN framework that leverages prompting and contextual learning, and com-

## Abstract

Text Normalization (TN) is a key preprocessing step in Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems, converting written forms into their canonical spoken equivalents. Traditional TN systems can exhibit high accuracy, but involve substantial engineering effort, are difficult to scale, and pose challenges to language coverage, particularly in low-resource settings. We propose PolyNorm, a prompt-based approach to TN using Large Language Models (LLMs), aiming to reduce the reliance on manually crafted rules and enable broader linguistic applicability with minimal human intervention. Additionally, we present a language-agnostic pipeline for automatic data curation and evaluation, designed to facilitate scalable experimentation across diverse languages. Experiments across eight languages show consistent reductions in the word error rate (WER) compared to a productiongrade-based system. To support further research, we release PolyNorm-Benchmark, a multilingual data set covering a diverse range of text normalization phenomena.

## 1 Introduction

TN transforms written input, often dense with numbers, abbreviations, and special characters, into fluent speech-friendly text. Early TN systems relied primarily on rule-based approaches using weighted finite-state transducers (WFSTs) (Sproat et al., 2001). Although such systems have historically achieved high accuracy, they depend heavily on manual rules and extensive human verification, making them expensive and time-consuming to develop and maintain. These challenges are even more pronounced when dealing with low-resource or morphologically rich languages, such as Arabic and Polish (Mosquera et al., 2012; Po´ swiata and Perełkiewicz, 2019), where linguistic diversity complicates the creation of rules. Beyond the pares multiple LLMs across diverse languages. Our research pursues two primary goals: (1) developing a sustainable, cost-effective TN solution with minimal human involvement, and (2) creating a reliable, language-agnostic process for automatic data curation and evaluation applicable across both high- and low-resource languages, offering a scalable and accessible TN solution for modern TTS systems.

## 2 Data

Our research focuses on American English, German, French, Mexican Spanish, Italian, Lithuanian, Japanese, and Mandarin Chinese.

We start with a subset of the English Kestrel dataset (Ebden and Sproat, 2015) comprising 14 Kestrel categories extracted from the first file of the dataset, which contains approximately 880,000 lines. For English, to construct a balanced subset, we select a total of 1,400 test cases, removing all sentences that lack normalization targets and retaining the first 100 examples per category from the Kestrel dataset for benchmarking purposes. We initially experimented with translating both the original and normalized English texts into the target languages with NLLB-200 model (Facebook AI, 2022). However, we found most translated texts unsuitable as ground truth due to inconsistent quality, translation and inadequate localization of the normalized forms. In addition, the limited categories do not fully cover the scope of normalization phenomena that we aim to evaluate. Therefore, instead of using the entire subset for benchmarking, we reserved some of the higher-quality data, reviewed and verified by language experts, as part of the prompt examples, which will be discussed in the Methodology section.

To address these challenges, we use DeepSeekR1 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025) to generate datasets comprising unnormalized and normalized text pairs as our new multilingual benchmark suite, PolyNormBenchmark 2 , designed to ensure consistency across languages and taxonomies. Each dataset spans 27 normalization categories (listed in Table 1) built on Kestrel categories and expanded with new classes, comprising 20 examples per category for a total of 540 high-quality data points per language. For Chinese and Japanese, we define abbreviations as truncated forms or initial-letter substitutions, since conventional definitions may not fully capture their

use in conversational language.

The initial outputs of DeepSeek serve as a foundation, then each example is subsequently edited and verified by internal language experts to ensure the highest standards of linguistic precision, naturalness, and overall quality. The orthography and formatting of synthetic data follow the conventions of target languages. For example, in French, decimal separator in currency is written with a comma instead of a period, with the currency symbol after the number:

## 3 Methodology

We define a normalization error as any output in which the normalized text deviates from the expected conventional spoken form. For example, rendering 'Dr' as 'Doctor' instead of 'Drive' in an address, or normalizing '12:30' as 'twelve thirty AM' when the time format is ambiguous.

For clarity and consistency, we standardize normalization to common conventions across languages when applicable. For instance, in American English, we follow the month-day-year format, consistent with our TTS production system expectations. Years like '2020' are normalized as twenty twenty , and dates such as '4/18' are normalized as april eighteenth .

Orig:

Norm (accepted): may twentieth twenty twenty three

Norm (rejected):

and twenty three

Certain differences are not considered errors in our evaluation, as they do not affect the semantic or phonetic realization of the text. These include casing, optional spacing (e.g., in German compound words), and orthographic variants such as 'ß' vs. 'ss' in specific German contexts, ensuring the evaluation focuses on differences affecting meaning, pronunciation, or intelligibility. To identify such issues and iteratively refine our system, we collaborate with language experts who review LLM outputs on our development sets and flag inaccuracies or inconsistencies, which inform benchmark corrections, in-context learning (ICL) examples refinements, and system iterations.

We adopt a few-shot prompting strategy using ICL examples to guide the LLM in performing text normalization across all languages. This approach allows the model to generalize from a small number of curated examples across various categories, from numerical expressions to acronyms, eliminating extensive fine-tuning or rule-based engineering.

Our prompt design follows a structured, step-bystep and language-agnostic format composed of three components: 1) Instruction Prompt , which defines the normalization task, 2) In-Context Learning Examples , which demonstrate how different types of text should be normalized, and 3) Target Unnormalized Input , to which the model applies learned patterns. PolyNorm uses a standardized English instruction prompt with localized ICL examples tailored to each language's linguistic and stylistic norms.

## 3.1 ICL Examples

Few-shot prompting with ICL offers a lightweight, scalable solution for multilingual text normalization, relying on high-quality, language-specific examples. The effectiveness of this approach depends on the quality and relevance of the ICL examples provided to the model. We use a unified prompt format across eight languages, varying only the localized examples-except for Japanese, where a supplementary prompt guides katakana output. Our curated ICL set, excluded from PolyNorm-Bench, includes 80-100 high-quality machine-translated Kestrel data and DeepSeek synthetic examples (e.g., favoring 'twenty nineteen' over 'two thou- sand nineteen' for '2019' in English), each normalized and validated by experts to ensure stylistic consistency across domains.

## 3.2 Error Analysis and Hillclimbing Iteration

We analyzed discrepancies between expert-verified development sets and LLM outputs from GPT models to identify systematic weaknesses. Common errors included incorrect numeral expansions and inconsistent handling of language-specific formats such as date and currency. To address these issues, we identified categories or patterns where the model underperformed, then revised or added ICL examples focused on these error types, improving the model's output with each iteration. This feedback loop refined normalization via prompt tuning and better examples, reducing errors and improving cross-lingual consistency.

## 4 Results

We evaluated GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o as candidate systems against Apple Siri production rulebased normalization baseline system. Because it is proprietary, we cannot release code or provide external access. However, to help readers judge strength and fairness, we report baseline scores for a representative subset of seven categories across all eight languages in Table 4 below 3 . It is important to note that the baseline predates our benchmark and was not tuned to it.

All systems were tested on PolyNorm across eight languages listed in Table 2. We report the overall performance with Word Error Rate (WER) and BLEU, which reflects how closely the model's output matches the expected spoken form and relative surface similarity to the reference respectively. For non-whitespace languages (Chinese and Japanese), we report Character Error Rate instead of WER to avoid conflating tokenization errors with true normalization errors. PolyNorm demonstrates substantial advantages in terms of flexibility, coverage, and the ability to handle previously intractable normalization challenges with minimal manual human intervention. Results in Table 2 show improvements in both WER and BLEU across the two LLM systems compared to the rule-based baseline. GPT4o achieves a WER ranging from 4.17% to 7.88% for all languages.

We observe that domain-specific constructs, such as website URLs and usernames, which rely on static rules, often pose challenges for tokenization and rule-based normalization due to their inherent unpredictability and rapid evolution. PolyNorm addresses these challenges with the contextual capabilities of LLMs to intelligently segment such expressions. For instance, https://www.mediacityuk.co.uk is normalized as h t t p s colon slash slash media city u k dot co dot u k .

Another observation of PolyNorm's context awareness over rule-based systems is its handling of dashes between numbers. In sports scores, a dash is typically verbalized as 'to' (e.g., '3-2' as 'three to two'), whereas in phone numbers it is ignored and the digits are read individually. A rulebased system would require an explicit and often verbose set of context-specific rules to make this distinction, while PolyNorm can infer the correct interpretation directly from context, even in novel or ambiguous formats.

## 5 Discussion

## 5.1 Impact

Training a reliable TTS system can require millions of high-quality data points. While effective in controlled environments, traditional TN pipelines, heavily rule-based, demand ongoing annotation and patching, often taking months per language and struggling to generalize or scale to noisy, ambiguous, or evolving inputs. PolyNorm replaces this manual loop with an LLM-driven framework using prompt tuning and in-context learning, cutting development overhead and accelerating iteration by refining prompts or examples.

Crowdsourcing normalization can be expensive, and it takes weeks of review cycles. PolyNorm, combined with few-shot in-context learning, achieves high grapheme-to-phoneme accuracy with far fewer labeled examples, lowering the barrier for TN in low-resource languages. Beyond cost and efficiency gains, LLM-based TN offers more consistent outputs, better generalization, and language-agnostic deployment, while allowing localized examples to boost performance. By reducing manual effort and speeding iteration, PolyNorm lets developers focus on quality and localization, accelerating research and production.

## 5.2 Future Work

Future work for PolyNorm includes enabling diacritization restoration in languages like Arabic and Hebrew, where diacritics serve critical grammatical and phonetic roles, and missing markers affect grammar and pronunciation. Targeted prompting could improve accuracy and naturalness of speech synthesis. Japanese and other non-whitespace languages could benefit from integrated tokenizers and multitask learning. While normalizing input to Katakana resolves homograph ambiguities (e.g., 〇 read as 'rei,' 'zero,' or 'maru') in Japanese, it may disrupt pitch accent patterns crucial for naturalness. Future work should incorporate suprasegmental features like pitch accent and tone prediction into the normalization pipeline.

## 6 Conclusion

We present PolyNorm, a multilingual, LLMassisted text normalization system designed to address scalability, cost, and language-coverage limitations of rule-based systems. It achieves strong normalization performance across languages and categories, and significantly reduces WER compared to production-grade rule-based systems, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability.

Beyond performance, PolyNorm represents a paradigm shift in how normalization systems can be developed, maintained, and scaled. The use of instruct prompting and in-context learning enables rapid iteration cycles, eliminates the dependency on handcrafted rules, and lowers the entry barrier for low-resource languages and domain-specific applications. Our language-agnostic prompt design and PolyNorm-Benchmark further establish a foundation for standardized evaluation and future research in LLM-based normalization. As we look ahead, expanding our system to handle complex linguistic phenomena such as diacritization, non-whitespace tokenization, and suprasegmental features will further broaden its applicability, making high-quality TTS systems accessible across a wider range of languages and user contexts.

## 8 Ethical Consideration

## 8.1 Lay Summary

This project explores using large language models (LLMs) to automate text normalization-a key step in processing raw text such as speech transcripts, handwriting, or informal writing. Text normalization standardizes text by handling tasks from formatting dates and numbers to restoring diacritics in accented languages. Our LLM-based system offers a scalable, efficient alternative by combining raw input with tailored prompts and few-shot examples. This approach improves consistency and quality across multiple languages, making it wellsuited for applications like text-to-speech, machine translation, and speech recognition.

## 8.2 AI Safety Disclosure

LLM-based normalization introduces ethical and safety risks. Because the model learns from large datasets, it may replicate biases in the training data. For example, in gendered languages like Arabic, ambiguous inputs such as 'ant' (which could mean 'you [masc.]' or 'you [fem.]') might be resolved in biased ways. If unaddressed, such biases can reinforce stereotypes or generate inappropriate outputs. Inaccurate normalization may also mislead learners, reinforce incorrect usage, and reduce trust in downstream systems. Therefore, while PolyNorm offers efficient, multilingual normalization, it must be developed with careful attention to data quality, bias mitigation, and user safety to ensure ethical deployment.

## 9 Limitations

While PolyNorm demonstrates strong potential in terms of efficiency and multilingual consistency, the model's performance is highly dependent on the quality and representativeness of data used as in-context learning examples. Categories covered in the examples may not capture the full range of normalization needs across different languages and varieties. Furthermore, errors in normalization can propagate into downstream tasks such as translation, sentiment analysis, or educational tools. Although expert-reviewed examples were used for in-context learning, the model may still struggle with edge cases or uncommon linguistic patterns. These limitations must be addressed before considering the system for widespread or critical work.

## Appendix

## A Instruction Prompt Template

This section presents the instruction prompt template. Note that certain locales include supplementary prompts tailored to their linguistic or stylistic characteristics. In-context learning (ICL) examples are omitted here for brevity.

You are an accurate text normalizer for { locale } . Your task is to normalize unstandardized text from the following categories to truly reflects how the real speech is, based on the context:

- Cardinal
- Date
- Decimal
- Ordinal
- Fraction
- Time
- Currency
- Unit (Measure)
- Electronic Address (URL or Email)
- Initialism or Acronym
- ISBN
- Roman Numeral
- Telephone
- Sports Score
- Mathematical Expression
- Symbol
- Abbreviation
- Chemical Formula
- Legal Reference
- Vehicle or Product Code
- Geographic Coordinates
- Version Number
- License Plate or Serial Number
- Musical Notation
- Stock Ticker
- Biological Classification
- Address
- Other unnormalized text

Some important rules:

- When normalizing acronyms, spell out to their full forms for clarity, except when the acronym is a widely recognized and pronounceable name (e.g. 'NASA' or 'NASCAR'). In those cases, keep the acronym as-is and pronounce it as a word.

- If the acronym combines a letter and a word, split accordingly.
- Convert punctuation that is spoken aloud into words. For example, write 'dot' instead of a period in URLs and emails.
- To ensure clarity, segment compound words, websites and file names into recognizable component words rather than keeping them as a whole word.
- Symbols in a file name should be read as is.
- Common file extensions (.jpeg, .jpg, .txt, etc) should be spoken out. Uncommon file extensions should be spelled out.
